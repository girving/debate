Stochastic doubly-efficient debate formalization
================================================

[![build](https://github.com/girving/debate/actions/workflows/lean.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/girving/debate/actions/workflows/lean.yml)

**Summary:** We formalize the correctness of the main stochastic oracle
doubly-efficient debate protocol from
[Brown-Cohen, Irving, Piliouras (2023), Scalable AI safety via doubly-efficient debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14125)
in Lean 4.

[Irving, Christiano, Amodei (2018), AI safety via debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899)
is one approach to AI alignment of strong agents, using two agents ("provers")
competing in a zero-sum game to convince a human judge ("verifier") of the truth
or falsity of a claim.  Theoretically, if we model the judge as a polynomial
time Turing machine, optimal play in the debate game can convince the judge of
any statement in PSPACE.  However, this theoretical model is limited in several
ways: the agents are assumed to have unbounded computational power, which is not
a realistic assumption for ML agents, and the results consider only
deterministic arguments.

[Brown-Cohen, Irving, Piliouras (2023), Scalable AI safety via doubly-efficient debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14125)
improves the complexity theoretic model of debate to be "doubly-efficient": both
the provers and the verifier have limited computational power.  It also treats
stochastic arguments: the provers try to convince the judge of the result of a
randomized computation involving calls to a random oracle.  Concretely, the main
formalized result is

**Definition 6.1 (Lipschitz oracle machines).** An oracle Turing machine
$M^\mathcal{O}$ is $K$-Lipschitz if, for any other oracle $\mathcal{O}'$ s.t.
$|\Pr(\mathcal{O}(z)) - \Pr(\mathcal{O}'(z))| \le \epsilon$, we have
$|\Pr(M^\mathcal{O}(x)) - \Pr(M^\mathcal{O'}(x))| \le K \epsilon$.

**Theorem 6.2 (doubly-efficient stochastic oracle debate).** Let $L$ be a
language decidable by a $K$-Lipschitz probabilistic oracle Turing machine
$M^\mathcal{O}$ in time $T = T(n)$, measuring oracle queries only as costing
time.  Then there is an $O(K^2 T \log T)$ prover time, $O(K^2)$ verifier time
debate protocol with cross-examination deciding $L$ with completeness $3/5$ and
soundness $3/5$.

The formalized result differs from the paper result slightly in that we focus
only on correctness: we do not yet formalize space complexity, count only oracle
queries for time complexity, and represent those queries only via the code for
the protocol.  We also define Lipschitz oracle machines differently: the paper
fixes $M$ and lets both $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{O}'$ vary, while we fix both
$M$ and $\mathcal{O}$ and let only $\mathcal{O}'$ vary (this slightly
strengthens the resulting theorem).
